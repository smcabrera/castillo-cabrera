Other than these dotfiles your development laptop should include a few other things

- thoughtbot/laptop

There's a script you can find on github called thoughtbot/laptop--this has all the software you'll need to get up and running. Run the script, wait 15 minutes and your rails dev environment is all set to go.

- laptop.local

Besides these defaults, I've defined some gems and programs that I like in laptop.local, which should all be installed right afterward

- Fish

Go install the fish shell. Seems really cool from the minimal playing around with it I've done. At some point I'd like to switch over to Xiki, but it seems a bit complicated to setup for the time being.

- Powerline

Make vim, tmux and bash and zsh give you extra information and look really nice

Go ahead and install this one for use with fish, which isn't supported by the above (as far as I know)
